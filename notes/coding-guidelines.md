# Coding Guidelines

The following rules are required when building this application.

1. Implementation must be as lightweight and simple as possible to setup and run on a local machine.


2. Any hard pieces need to be prebuilt to help in this.


3. Any AI generated code must be marked as such in the code file. Example:


    # Code block generated by AI. [model]
    # [prompt]
    print('Hello world')
    # ---

4. No [vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding). If you don't understand what the code does, you can't use it.


5. Implementation must be AI agnostic. Easy to switch out models as required.


6. All prompts/crew/tasks must be independent of the code.
